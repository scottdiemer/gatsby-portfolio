        ðŸ‘‹Hi, Iâ€™m Scott! A Front-End Developer based in Orlando, Florida. I have
        a passion for building web applications that are performant, accessible,
        and offer a great overall user experience! I love learning, so youâ€™ll
        always find me working on random side projects, watching coding videos,
        listening to podcasts and reading articles. I also participate in the
        #100DaysOfCode challenge, which Iâ€™ve completed multiple times.

        My coding journey began when the internet was still in itâ€™s infancy. I
        came across a person on AOL that was using an app that they written to
        knock someone offline. At the time, I just remember being amazed that
        something like that was even possible! So, I started asking around to
        find out how it was done. At the time, most of those apps were written
        in Visual Basic and were accessing DLL files to do the lower level
        functionality. This is when I decided to go down the path of learning to
        code. Shortly afterwards, I was able to build the type of app that had
        sparked my imagination. This is when I knew I was hooked! I enrolled at
        Winter Park Tech in the Business Computer Programming course which
        involved 600+ hours and learning languages such as Visual Basic and C++.
